Started with existing React portfolio website. Recently added Tailwind CSS and started incremental migration away from Aphrodite (and maybe Material UI components).

# Day 1

Added a statistics section: "Deep gets results" with numbers.

Changed text. 


# Day 2

Added testimonial section. The testimonial is from my LinkedIn (past experience).

Added LogosSection. Found logos for past companies.

# Day 3

Need inspiration tbh. 

- I could improve the Skills and Work section.
- I definitely need better projects.
- I could migrate over to Next.js
- I could add the blog.

Adding the blog is most relevant. Then migrating over to Next.js, bc future back-end changes.

Working on adding the blog. Would like a microsite architecture, but not sure how to do it.

# Day 4

Actually, this is the codebase migration to a next.js build system (and maybe some of the work for my own back-end/server) that I'm doing during the break before the next pathway of class. More of time went to the community (mine was a blog) website.
